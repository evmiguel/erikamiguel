            <h2>About Me</h2>
          </div>
          <p>I am a 24 year-old born and bred New Yorker. In 2015, I graduated from Smith College and started as a Software Developer at a big bank in New York City. I have since worked in a mix of DevOps roles, ranging from mostly ops, to now purely dev. I am passionate about IoT, SRE, and all things related to a computer.</p>
          <p>Outside of tech, I enjoy yoga, spending time with family, and tinkering around on my Pi. I also love to travel when I can. My most recent adventures in the last five years have been in Spain, Argentina, Canada, UK, Amsterdam, Belgium, France, Italy, Southern Germany, and the Philippines. My partner and I have recently moved to Somerville, Massachusetts. Cheers to new adventures!</p>
