            <h2>About Me</h2>
          </div>
          <p>I am a 24 year-old born and bred New Yorker. In 2015, I graduated from Smith College and started my career as a DevOps Engineer, developing my interests in troubleshooting, empowering developers to incorporate ops into their workflows, and diversity in tech. I have experience with AWS tools, Python, Bash, Java, and AngularJS. I'm command-line full time to be well versed in navigating Linux servers.</p>
          <p>Outside of tech, I enjoy yoga, spending time with family, and tinkering around on my Arduino. I also love to travel when I can. My most recent adventures in the last five years have been in Spain, Argentina, Canada, UK, Amsterdam, Belgium, France, Italy, Southern Germany, and the Philippines. My partner and I have recently moved to Somerville, Massachusetts. Cheers to new adventures!</p>
