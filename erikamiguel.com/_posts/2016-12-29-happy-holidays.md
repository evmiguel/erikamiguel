Happy holidays, folks! Hope you have a good and relaxing holiday. My sister bought me this [alarm clock](https://www.amazon.com/Clocky-Alarm-Clock-Wheels-White/dp/B000PWLTNA) that runs away from you when it goes off! As soon as I removed the clock from the packaging, it fell onto the floor and the wheel broke off. Moreover, the impact of the fall ripped the wheel's wires off of the circuit board, resulting in a sad little clock. Instead of being sad that  my clock broke, I took the clock apart, fixed the wheel's gears, and (with my grandfather's help) sautered the wires back to the circuit board. I learned a lot about the  mechanics of gears, attaching wires to  circuit boards, and my grandfather's electronics business in the Philippines. What turned out to be a cute, silly gift, was,  instead, an awesome learning and bonding experience. A good Christmas, indeed.

My friends' [website](https://coletteandjen.com) is coming along. The part that I'm really excited to build out is their guestbook, which will store responses in DynamoDB. I should also figure out a way for my friends to save guestbook itself... Anyway, this is a very fun project because I am learning more serverless and also doing a good thing to help my friends. 

Until next time!
