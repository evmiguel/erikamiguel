I really wanted to build something that could be on AWS Lambda and API Gateway. So, I built an appointment form, mainly for chatting with people about projects they want to work on. I'd rather have a short phone call than read through really long e-mails.

It took me 19 days to build a prototype for the form. mostly because I work full-time. I'm happy that I now have a controlled way to gauge who wants to talk to me. If anyone wants to chat, feel free to mark some time down!
