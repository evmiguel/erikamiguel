It's been three weeks now since Meg and I have moved to Somerville. While I know New York City will always be in my heart and in my collection of life experiences, I have to say that I am very much enjoying our new Massachusetts lifestyle. Our apartment is an entire floor of a three story house, our room about half the size of our NYC fifth floor walk-up, which we shared with a roommate. The walls are painted in pastel blues and yellows, and the floors creak from a long history of being a well loved home. There is a well established concord grape vine in the backyard (best grapes ever!), and when it is warm outside, Meg, Emma (our dear friend and roommate), and I can eat or chill on the porch. The neighborhood is dead quiet at night, unlike the racous activity that stemmed from living across the street from the fire department on 85th Street. Life right now is good and balanced. I feel like I can take more time to grow because the days of subconscious stress from living in NYC are finally over.

Now that our perpatetic lifestyle has come to an end, I have taken time to assess the habits that help me in my day to day and in my life in general. I am by no means at all finished developing good habits, and I strive to improve on the things I know I need to improve on (yes, the pile of laundry on the couch is still there... and yes, I really should stop leaving dishes on every table of the house...). I won't be 24 forever, so I believe that creating such habits now will, hopefully, help me when I am 34, 44, 54, and so on. Obviously, my methods won't work for everyone, so I hope you enjoy the read and pick your own implementations!

## Minimize the wardrobe

I'm dead serious. When I was an undergraduate, I meticulously picked every outfit, from my shirt to my socks. There was no hair out of place. My tie pin had to match my suspenders. I was a seriously dapper dame. When I look back to those photos from undergrad (dang, I was fine.), I realize how many more hours I could have spent reading about a certain technology or catching up with family. 

I've cut down my wardrobe significantly since then. From what I do have, I allocate per occasion. For the work week, I designate 3 pairs of pants, 3 favorite long sleeves, 2 favorite t-shirts, and 2 types of shoes. Yes, I am shamelss about repeating outfits, but honestly, I don't have to think that much about my appearance, save for personal hygiene -- do that, it's important. Not worrying about my appearance too much, saves me more mental energy to devote to learning and pursuing my passions.

## Establish a morning routine

When I wake up in the morning, I put on the water kettle and, after the water boils, I make my morning concoction: hot water with a shot of unfiltered apple cider vinegar and honey. This drink get my body going because the sourness boosts me into awareness and the heat from the hot water gets things moving. After I have my drink, I do about half an hour of morning stretches and get ready for work after that.

It's a simple routine, but it helps my mind and body settle into the morning. Whatever routine works for you, it should be something that prepares you for the intentions you set for the day.

## Spend "in-between" hours effectively

I think of "in-between" hours as the time spent when you are getting from one place to another or time spent waiting at the doctor's office, etc. It's basically any time that you are passive, but not chilling. You feel me?

When I am driving to work, for example, I love to listen to podcasts. My favorite podcasts are:
1. Rocket: a tech podcast run by three badass women in tech who rant-chat about the industry
2. TED Radio Hour Podcast: a podcast that explores new ideas and developments based on famous TED talks
3. Developers Tea: an overall good podcast that combines career advice for those in tech in an almost self-help format 

Sometimes, I deliberately daydream. I take the time to think about what I would do with my life if I had unlimited amounts of money. I think about meeting my 18-year-old self and showing her how far we've come. I think about my 30-year-old self and seeing where she's going. Thinking in this way helps me filter out the noise coming from the perfect lives I see on Instagram and avoid comparing myself to how I think others are living. Dreaming in this way helps me compare myself to my timeline so that I can be better than I am today.

## To do lists

For some, it's a hand written checklist. For others, it's a personal Trello board. I've picked my poison. Google Keep. It's my absolute favorite thing to use when I need to quickly jot down what I need to do for the day before I forget... because that's starting to happen now. I've used Google Keep so much to keep track of each task of my chores that if I don't write a task down in Keep, it just doesn't get done.

This isn't just for short term goals or errands either. If something needs to happen, just write it down.

## Yes time and No time

This is the most important habit that I have picked up as a young professional. When you go to work for 8 hours a day, both in an office or remote, assuming you get home at 6pm and sleep at 11pm, you only have about five hours of free time. Four assuming you cook dinner for one hour. Three if you spend one hour scrolling through your social media feeds -- just kidding! Or am I?

In my three hours, I could be trying to figure out if I should call my mom back and use up an hour, spend all my time watching Chef's Table, or refreshing on some CS concepts. Ok, I could probably do without another episode of Chef's Table, but it's definitely hard to choose between upkeeping the relationships I have and my personal goals. I recognize that some things have to give. I might not get the chance to read up on a new technology today because I did decide that calling my mom was worth it. Or, I might feel terrible to telling my friend who lives down the block that I am busy, but I decided that I so badly needed to learn the Composite pattern. 

Whetever it is, as long as I note what I want to do in my Keep list, I know I'll get to it. It's a good loop.
