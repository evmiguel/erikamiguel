New toy! Last month, visiting the office of my new job, the circuit boards, citcuit diagrams, and firmware algos inspired me. I recalled the diagrams I drew in my old engineering classes, though I only took two in college. 

I gave up engineering at Smith because I had a hard time adjusting to the workload expections. Though I preserved my mental health at the time (by a thread), to this day, I regret not fully pursuing the major. It's never to late to pick something up again.

So, looking for some practice, I bought an Arduino Uno and [Exploring Arduino](https://www.amazon.com/Exploring-Arduino-Techniques-Engineering-Wizardry/dp/1118549368/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494776470&sr=8-1&keywords=exploring+arduino) by Jeremy Blum. His book has fun examples ranging from simple LED circuit to exercises with speakers and servos.

Still waiting for the parts I ordered online. In the meantime, here is a play on a simple push button LED circuit. I did not add resistors to the LEDs because I wanted there to be enough voltage across the six LEDs. I call it the Smiley Circuit.

Tilt your head to the right and you should see the smile!
