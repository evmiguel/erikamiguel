That's right. I missed coding, and I'm happy to have found it again. With the mentorship of the lead software developer and lead DevOps architect at my job, I feel like I am going through a technical Rennaissance. OOP and patterns and algorithms are just.... so gosh darn beautiful. 

Programming is so much more fun now that I have dispelled my fears of servers and config tools. Ops work really is difficult, and having done that for the last year and a half, I have such a deep appreciation for the Ops side of DevOps. I was burned at the last company I worked for because they implied that I could do development, but I was siloed into AWS, Ops, and IT for 100% of my time there. With encouragement from my manager and teammates at my new job, I am so happy to be coding once more.

This is the path I am going to take.
