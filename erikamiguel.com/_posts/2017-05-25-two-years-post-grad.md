Taking a break from the usual DevOps/techie posts for a minute -- 

Last weekend I visited my alma mater's commencement to see Oprah deliver her commencement address to the class of 2017. When I heard that she would be this year's commencement speaker, I knew that I was going to make the trek to Smith, if only to fulfill my childhood dream of seeing her IRL. Her 4pm show on ABC 7 marked my afternoons as a middle school student. Her show sparked conversations about popular culture, health, and wealth between my family and me, amidst the housecleaning chores and math problems happening in our home. Fast forward about ten years later, Smith -- my alma mater, the place that molded me into a woke professional, the place that engaged me in upper class dialogue about the city I grew up in -- brings Oprah to our community, to me! 

In the audience, I listened to Oprah deliver her speech about the secret to her success. Though starstruck, I managed to take notes on what I thought was important advice. "How can I be used" she said, challenging us to put our talents into service, to use our skills to contribute to the world. Perhaps this is the same advice that all successful people give to budding adults, but I think that Oprah's speech took a spiritual path.

"Give because your cup runneth over", Oprah exclaimed, her voice bouncing the quadrangle's dorms. Her message of serving others in order to succeed yourself is a lesson that I have pondered in the last two years, after graduating in 2015.

Two years ago, in 2015, I came home from Smith, ferverish and disillusioned. Four years of intellectual journeying, emotional turmoil, and physical freedom all but vanished as I slept in my old bed in my parents' home in Yonkers. I felt like I lost my opportunity to do college right. I should have written the thesis. I should have gone abroad to another country. I should have. I should have. 

The second half of 2015 should have been called "The Disaster of Adulting". In my mind, there were too many things going on at once: prepping to move out of my parents' house, gearing up for my job at Goldman Sachs, missing my friends, missing people I loved. I spread myself too thin worrying about these things. I didn't know how to prioritize my life. I valued sticky situations over building my life productively. More or less, by the time I moved into my new apartment, I was desperate, lonely, and unfulfilled in my work.
