Taking a break from the usual DevOps/techie posts for a minute -- 

Last weekend I visited my alma mater's commencement to see Oprah deliver her commencement address to the class of 2017. When I heard that she would be this year's commencement speaker, I knew that I was going to make the trek to Smith, if only to fulfill my childhood dream of seeing her IRL. Her 4pm show on ABC 7 marked my afternoons as a middle school student. Her show sparked conversations about popular culture, health, and wealth between my family and me, amidst the housecleaning chores and math problems happening in our home. Fast forward about ten years later, Smith -- my alma mater, the place that molded me into a woke professional, the place that engaged me in upper class dialogue about the city I grew up in -- brings Oprah to our community, to me! 

In the audience, I listened to Oprah deliver her speech about the secret to her success. Though starstruck, I managed to take notes on what I thought was important advice. "How can I be used" she said, challenging us to put our talents into service, to use our skills to contribute to the world. Perhaps this is the same advice that all successful people give to budding adults, but I think that Oprah's speech took a spiritual path.

"Give because your cup runneth over", Oprah exclaimed, her voice bouncing the quadrangle's dorms. Her message of serving others in order to succeed yourself is a lesson that I have pondered in the last two years, after graduating in 2015.

My post-grad thus far: A digression --

Two years ago, in 2015, I came home from Smith, ferverish and disillusioned. Four years of intellectual journeying, emotional turmoil, and physical freedom all but vanished as I slept in my old bed in my parents' home in Yonkers. I felt like I lost my opportunity to do college right. I should have written the thesis. I should have gone abroad to another country. I should have. I should have. 

The second half of 2015 should have been called "The Disaster of Adulting". In my mind, there were too many things going on at once: prepping to move out of my parents' house, gearing up for my first job in fintech, missing my friends, missing people I loved. I spread myself too thin worrying about these things. I didn't know how to prioritize my life. I valued sticky situations over building my life productively. By the time I moved into my new apartment, I was desperate, lonely, and unfulfilled in my work. Two months into adulting, I had maxed out my credit card trying to feed myself because rent had taken most of my savings. What scared me most was being alone, after a long day of writing code that I didn't care about. No direction, no career plans, I was lost.

From June to November, I was trapped in a paycheck-to-paycheck cycle to bootstrap my life, not thinking about what I loved doing, who I wanted to be around, and where my future should go. Though my parents supported me emotionally and physically with leftovers, they did not have the means to help me financially or the knowledge of how to navigate a white collar profession. My life started turning around after Thanksgiving of 2015, when I decided that I wanted to leave my dress coded job to something more tech-oriented. So, I brushed up on my data structures for one month, and starting interviewing around for a new gig.

I didn't get a new job until April of 2016. One rejection and four months of resignation to never leaving my first job, I found a new job! From then, I began the DevOps journey that I am on today.

Though I haven't been out of school or working very long, life has taught me a few things around following my dreams. Like Oprah's message, I was not able to change my situation until I evaulated what I wanted to do and what I was good at. When I was trying to change jobs, I interviewed as a software engineer, when I did not have a big passion for it. I had to be open to accepting that I was built for a different type of tech, and that meant taking a job that built my DevOps career from scratch. 

How can I be used? Well, as of right now I love fixing shit on servers, dancing on the command-line for days, and building high level architecture so that the companies I work for can **deliver** their products and services efficiently and resiliently. I love what I do, and I am blessed that the dissatisfaction I felt in my early career pushed me to take inventory of my skills to find a job that I am fulfilled in. But, that's just the professional side. 

When I was lost, I did not keep clear tabs with my family. I was not open to loving myself. I was hanging out with the wrong personality types at my job. All of that took a negative toll on my life. In conjunction with my professional growth, I stopped hanging around the people at work who made me feel uncomfortable, I visited my family more often, and I got comfortable being by myself and taking care of my body. Through those changes, I was able to serve the people I love with my time. Something as simple as spending time with loved ones or in mindfulness allowed my cup to flow. 

Oprah's message is not something new. That day, she told the audience a formula for success that anyone who open enough would have found eventually.
