# Refactor In Progress...

## Serving the site locally

1. Install Local Dependencies
`npm install local-web-server`

2. Run local webserver
`ws --spa index.html` or `ws`

## Thoughts
1. Not committing to a framework as of yet. Instead, using this nice library for routing, [Navigo](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/). I like it because it has the capability to remove the hashes in the URL. This comes for free in the big frameworks, but I'm holding off for now.
